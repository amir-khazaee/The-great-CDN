# The Great CDN 

## Overview

The Great CDN enhances the delivery of digital assets—such as policy documents, customer portals, and internal applications—by reducing latency, increasing fault tolerance, and ensuring fast load times. Strategic deployment of CDN nodes in major cities across Iran improves the user experience for both internal stakeholders and external customers.

## Objectives

- **Performance Improvement:** Minimize latency for users accessing resources across different regions of Iran.
- **High Availability:** Ensure continuity and reliability of services even in case of localized failures.
- **Scalability:** Accommodate growth in traffic with a robust, distributed network.
- **Security:** Implement DDoS mitigation, SSL termination, and secure caching to protect critical insurance data.

## Architecture Overview

The CDN solution consists of the following components:
- **Edge Servers:** Located in major Iranian cities to cache static and dynamic content.
- **Origin Servers:** The central repository for all original content in a secure, resilient data center.
- **Load Balancers:** Distribute incoming traffic across edge servers.
- **DNS Routing:** Directs users to the nearest edge node based on geographic location and network conditions.
- **Monitoring & Analytics:** Continuous monitoring using Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.
- **Automation Tools:** Infrastructure-as-code with Terraform and configuration management using Ansible.

## Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Pilot Deployment
- **Initial Nodes:** Deploy edge servers in Tehran, Mashhad, and Tabriz.
- **Testing:** Validate performance, failover capabilities, and caching efficiency.
- **Feedback Loop:** Refine configurations and adjust load balancing strategies based on performance data.

### Phase 2: Full-Scale Rollout
- **Expansion:** Add nodes in Isfahan, Shiraz, Ahvaz, and Qom.
- **Optimization:** Implement advanced caching strategies and further tune DNS routing.
- **Security Hardening:** Integrate enhanced security measures including WAF and DDoS mitigation.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Caching & Web Servers:** NGINX, Varnish Cache, or Apache Traffic Server.
- **Automation & Orchestration:** Terraform and Ansible.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.
- **Security:** SSL/TLS, WAF, and DDoS protection systems.

## Conclusion

Deploying CDN nodes in major Iranian cities allows Central Insurance to significantly improve performance, reduce latency, and deliver a highly available and secure digital experience. This plan supports current needs and scales for future growth.
